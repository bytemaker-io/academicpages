# Personal Statement
Hello, my name is Kaelan and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. My previous research has primarily focused on cloud computing and microservices, and I am well-versed in Kubernetes and distributed microservices.

However, I am now looking to delve deeper into the field of machine learning, particularly in its intersection with cloud computing and computer vision. As someone who has always been fascinated by the power of technology to enhance human lives, I believe that this field has immense potential for societal impact.

## Background
when I was first introduced to programming. Since then, I have spent countless hours exploring different programming languages and building small projects to hone my skills. During my undergraduate studies, I became interested in the field of cloud computing and microservices, which led me to pursue further research in this area.

## Research Interests
I am now eager to explore the intersection of machine learning and cloud computing, with a specific focus on computer vision. I am interested in the ways that machine learning can be used to analyze and process visual data in real-time, and how this can be leveraged for a variety of applications.

In particular, I believe that computer vision has the potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, transportation, and security. By combining my expertise in cloud computing and microservices with machine learning and computer vision, I hope to make meaningful contributions to these areas.

## Future Goals
Looking ahead, my goal is to become a leading expert in the field of machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on its intersection with cloud computing. I am committed to furthering my knowledge and skills in these areas, and to making contributions to the development of innovative technologies.

Ultimately, I hope to use my expertise to create solutions that address real-world problems and have a positive impact on society. I am excited to continue exploring this field and look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
